##Robo.Op
###*Industrial Robots. Open for Creativity.*


_Robo.Op_ is an open hardware / open software platform for hacking industrial robots (IRs). 
_Robo.Op_ makes it cheaper and easier to customize your IR for creative use, so you can _explore the fringes of industrial robotics_.

<br/><br/>
We built _Robo.Op_ to bypass the expensive, proprietary software and hardware currently offered by robotics companies. _Robo.Op_ enables artists and designers to _(a)_ develop affordable custom tools for creative robotics, and _(b)_ share tools and knowledge across robotic platforms.
<br/><br/>
_Robo.Op_ is made of three components:<br/>
<ul>
<li>The Robot Tool Adaptor (RTA) – a universal adaptor sheild for developing affordable, custom tools for creative robotics.</li>
<li>A Processing Interface – a simplified, modular software interface for cross-platform programming of IRs.</li>
<li>A Centralized Knowledge Hub - this github-hosted project for sharing knowledge, tools, and code.</li>
</ul>
